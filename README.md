# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview
Plan My Trip is a top travel technology company tghat specializes in internet related services in the hotel and lodging industry. My job was to help collect and present data for customers via the search page which they will then filter based on their preferred travel criteria in order to find their ideal hotel anywhere in the world. To do this, we will use the citipy module to get the cities based on latitudes and longitudes and then use the OpenWeatherMap API to perform requests and get the json weather information on these cities. The analysis will help me to pick the best time of year for our users to plan their vacations. Finally we will export the data, clean it, and use the weather data to choose the best cities for vacation based on weather criteria and then map these cities using Jupyter Gmaps and the GooglePlaces API.
